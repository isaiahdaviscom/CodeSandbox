[Commit of the Day]()
I started to look over the instructions, starter code, and design to breakdown the structure into logical components.

I looked over the code for an unfamiliar frameworks and discovered that the Card component was utilizing Styled Components.

The Research
Believing that this was intentional I opened another browser I opened a tab using the context clues in the code to reference later.



Quickly I built out the component folder structure and worked on getting the essential elements on the page.


# Components

##Select
##Button
##Card

Use Effect
Use State
